A simple mastodon bot that lets you play snake on mastodon as a community. This is based on the snake bot which [polymars](https://https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Twitter-Plays-Snake) made for twitter. Some major differences from that are that this is written in typescript rather than java and rather than having a two button control system(using likes and retweets), this uses polls on mastodon in order to have a full control scheme for the game. The bot's mastodon tag is [@snake@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@snake)

Rehosting the bot is fine but please avoid just rehosting it without making your own changes or a unique twist on the game.
