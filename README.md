# Mastodon Plays Snake

A simple mastodon bot that lets you play snake on mastodon as a community. This is based on the snake bot which [polymars](https://https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Twitter-Plays-Snake) made for twitter. Some major differences from that are that this is written in typescript rather than java and rather than having a two button control system(using likes and retweets), this uses polls on mastodon in order to have a full control scheme for the game.
